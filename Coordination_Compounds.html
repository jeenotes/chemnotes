                Complexes or coordination compounds are molecules that posess a metal center that is bound to ligands via a coordinate bond (atoms, ions, or                   molecules that donate electrons to the metal). These complexes can be neutral or charged.
                </br>
                </br>

                The branch of Inorganic Chemistry which studies about those compounds which are formed by coordinate bond is known as coordination chemistry.

                </br>
                </br>

                Double salts are salts containing more than one cation or anion, obtained by combination of two different salts. The two different Salts are                   separated by a dot(.) in the formula.
                </br>

                The properties of double salts depend upon their constituent ions.
                </br>
                </br>

                Double salts break into their constituents in aqueous solution and give the qualitative test of all their constituent radicals. They are
                stable only in the solid state. In contrast, complexes do not break in an aqueous solution and do give qualitative test of their constituent
                radicals, neither do they show properties of their constituents. They are stable in both solid and liquid state.
