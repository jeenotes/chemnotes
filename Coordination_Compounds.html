        <h1> Coordination Chemistry </h1>
        </br>

        Complexes or coordination compounds are molecules that posess a metal center that is bound to ligands via a coordinate bond (atoms, ions, or molecules
        that donate electrons to the metal). These complexes can be neutral or charged.

        The branch of Inorganic Chemistry which studies about those compounds which are formed by coordinate bond is known as coordination chemistry.

        <h1> Difference between Double Salts and Coordination Compounds </h1>
        </br>
        
        Double salts are salts containing more than one cation or anion, obtained by combination of two different salts. The two different Salts are separated
        by a dot(.) in the formula.
